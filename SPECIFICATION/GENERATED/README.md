# GENERATED (auto / generated artifacts)

This directory contains generated artifacts and UML images for the GLIA project.
Purpose:
- Central place for all auto-generated diagrams, puml, and script outputs.
- Scripts (gen-uml.sh, sync-project.sh) should be updated to write outputs here.
- Human-edited specification files remain under SPECIFICATION/DOCS and SPECIFICATION root.
