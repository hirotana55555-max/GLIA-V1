# SPEC MAINTENANCE MODEL

SPEC has higher authority than implementation.

When SPEC and code diverge:
1. Implementation is reverse-engineered.
2. Reverse_spec JSON is generated.
3. Human-LLM consultation occurs.
4. SPEC is amended or capsule redefined.

LLM Self-Modification Rules:
- Allowed only within approved capsules.
- Structural SPEC changes require human approval.
- Every change must be justifiable by failure analysis.

SPEC is a living contract, not documentation.
