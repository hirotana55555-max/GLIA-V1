# ANTIGRAVITY_IMPL (Phase 2.5 Fresh Start)

This directory is a fresh implementation zone for Phase 2.5.
All previous ANTIGRAVITY_IMPL contents were archived because they were
legacy mock structures inconsistent with Phase 2.5.

## Rules for Phase 2.5 Antigravity Work

- Must follow 3.5-layer separation strictly.
- Browser operation MUST go through BrowserManager (Playwright).
- SIE Execution → BrowserManager delegation is mandatory.
- No mock implementations inside this directory.
- This directory may contain:
  - prototypes
  - generated implementation drafts
  - temporary evaluation code
